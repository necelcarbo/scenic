In the following paragraphs, we will briefly introduce some of the main topics covered in the book Statistics for Business and Economics by Paul Newbold, William Carlson and Betty Thorne.
 
## Descriptive Statistics
 
Descriptive statistics are methods of summarizing and displaying data using tables, graphs and numerical measures. Descriptive statistics help us to understand the characteristics and patterns of a data set, such as the center, spread, shape and outliers. Some of the common descriptive statistics include mean, median, mode, standard deviation, range, quartiles, percentiles, frequency distributions, histograms, boxplots and scatterplots.
 
## Probability
 
Probability is the study of uncertainty and randomness. Probability helps us to quantify the likelihood of an event or outcome occurring in a given situation. Probability can be calculated using rules of counting, axioms of probability, conditional probability and Bayes' theorem. Probability can also be modeled using discrete or continuous probability distributions, such as binomial, Poisson, normal, uniform and exponential distributions.
 
## Sampling
 
Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals or items from a population for the purpose of making inferences about the population. Sampling can be done using various methods, such as simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling and systematic sampling. Sampling can also be affected by sources of error, such as sampling error and nonsampling error. Sampling helps us to estimate population parameters using sample statistics and confidence intervals.
