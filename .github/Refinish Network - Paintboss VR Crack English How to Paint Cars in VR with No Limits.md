On Metacritic, the movie has a score of 35 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Roger Ebert gave the movie two stars out of four, writing: \"The refitted UniSols look like muscular human beings, but wear funny little monoculars that send out a TV signal (of startlingly low quality). They are strong, acrobatic and versatile, and can be controlled by their leaders, but wouldn't you know that two of the units have combat flashbacks to Vietnam, and remember that they hate one another.\" [^1^]
 
However, some critics and fans have appreciated the movie for its entertainment value and cult status. Leonard Maltin gave the movie three stars out of four, calling it \"a fast-paced actioner with some clever twists\". Empire magazine ranked it at number 18 on its list of \"The 50 Greatest Guilty Pleasures\". The movie also won a Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films.

Universal Soldier also has some memorable quotes that reflect the personalities and motivations of the characters. For example, Scott says to Deveraux: \"You're dead soldier... No... I'm alive.\" This shows how Scott is obsessed with killing Deveraux, while Deveraux is determined to survive and reclaim his identity. Another example is when Deveraux says to Scott: \"You're discharged... sarge.\" This shows how Deveraux has overcome his fear and obedience to Scott, and asserts his independence and defiance.
 
The movie also has some humorous moments, such as when Deveraux asks Veronica to help him look for a tracer on his naked body. He says: \"Look for something hard.\" He then looks down and asks: \"Is that supposed to be there?\" Veronica replies: \"Yes, yes it's very normal.\" This scene shows how Deveraux is naive and curious about his body, while Veronica is embarrassed and flustered by his question.
 
Universal Soldier can be compared with other sci-fi action movies that feature super-soldiers, such as RoboCop, Terminator, Captain America, and The Bourne Identity. These movies explore themes such as identity, memory, morality, technology, and violence. They also showcase spectacular action sequences and special effects that appeal to fans of the genre.
