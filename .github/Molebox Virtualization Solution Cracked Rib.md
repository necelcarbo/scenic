# How to Use Molebox Virtualization Solution to Create Portable and Secure Applications
 
Molebox Virtualization Solution (MVS) is a software tool that allows you to create application-specific and secure virtual environments for your software applications, isolating them from the underlying operating system and other software installed and running on the host device. This can help you avoid application conflicts, DLL hell, registry issues, and installation problems. It can also protect your applications from unauthorized use and modification.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use MVS to create portable and secure applications that can run without installation on any computer, from any source - USB device, CD-ROM, or network drive. We will also explain how MVS works and what benefits it can bring to your software development and distribution.

## What is Molebox Virtualization Solution?
 
MVS is a software tool that creates application-specific and secure virtual environments for your software applications. It does this by placing the application and all of its elements into managed packages which form the following virtual layers in runtime:
 
- Virtual file system: provides the application with transparent access to original files while protecting them from unauthorized use
- Virtual registry: allows using ActiveX components without registration and overriding existing registry values while protecting the host registry from modifications

MVS lets you convert your application into an all-sufficient stand-alone executable, containing everything needed: components, media assets, registry entries and runtime settings. Moleboxed environment is private and secure, which means that all packaged elements are available to your application only and are protected from any unauthorized access.
 
## How to Use Molebox Virtualization Solution?
 
To use MVS, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download and install MVS from [https://sudachen.github.io/Molebox/](https://sudachen.github.io/Molebox/)
2. Launch MVS and select "Create new project" from the main menu
3. Add your main executable file and any other files that your application needs to run (such as DLLs, ActiveX components, media files, etc.) to the project
4. Configure the virtual file system and virtual registry settings according to your needs
5. Select "Build project" from the main menu to create a moleboxed executable file
6. Test your moleboxed application on different computers and devices
