One of the key skills in organic chemistry is to know how to use different reagents to achieve various transformations of organic molecules. Reagents are substances that cause a chemical reaction or change in another substance. For example, reagents can be used to add or remove functional groups, change the oxidation state, or create new bonds.
  
There are many types of reagents in organic chemistry, each with its own function and mechanism. Some of the common reagents are acids, bases, oxidizing agents, reducing agents, nucleophiles, electrophiles, radicals, catalysts, and solvents. To master organic chemistry, it is important to learn the names, structures, functions, and reactions of these reagents.
  
However, memorizing all the reagents and their functions can be challenging and time-consuming. That is why we have prepared this guide for you.
