One of his most influential works is *Psychologia stresu* (Psychology of Stress), published in 1990. In this book, Terelak presents a comprehensive overview of the theoretical and empirical aspects of stress, its sources, consequences, and coping strategies. He also discusses the role of individual differences, such as personality traits, attachment styles, and emotional intelligence, in moderating the effects of stress. He integrates various perspectives and approaches to stress, such as cognitive, behavioral, physiological, social, and existential.
 
*Psychologia stresu* is a valuable resource for students, researchers, and practitioners who are interested in understanding and managing stress in various contexts, such as work, family, health, education, and military. The book is written in a clear and accessible style, with numerous examples and case studies. It also provides practical guidelines and recommendations for enhancing well-being and resilience in the face of stress.
 
The book is available in Polish only, but some of Terelak's articles have been translated into English and other languages. For example, he has co-authored papers on sense of coherence and coping styles in Turkish students (Terelak & Budka, 2006), work-family interface and job satisfaction in Polish employees (Terelak & BasiÅska, 2010), and validation of a computer model of stress response (Terelak & Fetchet, 1992).
