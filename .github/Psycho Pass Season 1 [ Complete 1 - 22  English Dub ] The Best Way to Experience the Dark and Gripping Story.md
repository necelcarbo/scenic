Psycho Pass is a sci-fi anime series that explores the themes of justice, morality, and free will in a futuristic society where people's mental states are measured by a system called the Sibyl System. The Sibyl System assigns each person a crime coefficient, which indicates their likelihood of committing a crime. Those who have high crime coefficients are either arrested or killed by special police officers called Inspectors and their subordinates, Enforcers.
 
The first season of Psycho Pass follows Akane Tsunemori, a rookie Inspector who joins the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division. She works alongside Shinya Kogami, an Enforcer who was once an Inspector but became a latent criminal after witnessing a traumatic event. Together, they face various cases that challenge their views on justice and humanity.
